To-Do List with Reminders and Notifications
Objective:
Create a To-Do List app that allows users to manage their tasks, set reminders, and receive
local notifications for upcoming tasks & due tasks. It should work for both Android and IOS.

Requirements:

1. Task Management:
   ● Users should be able to:
   ○ Add new tasks with a title and optional description.
   ○ Edit existing tasks (title and description).
   ○ Mark tasks as completed or delete tasks.
   ● Each task should have the following fields:
   ○ Title (required)

○ Due Date and Time ( for setting reminders)
○ Reminder Notification ( triggers a notification at the due time)

2. Task List UI:
   ● Display a list of tasks.
   ● Show the following for each task:
   ○ Title
   ○ Due Date and Time (if applicable)
   ○ Task Status (Completed or Pending)
   ○ Option to delete or mark as completed
   ● Overdue tasks should be highlighted in a different color.
3. Setting Reminders:
   ● Users should be able to set a reminder for each task. The reminder should trigger a
   local notification.
   ● The notification should be triggered at the set due date and time.
   ● Notifications should contain the task title and description (if available).

4. Storage:
   ● Store tasks persistently so that they remain after the app is closed or restarted.

5. Notifications:
   ● Notifications should trigger only for tasks with a due date/time set and a reminder.
   ● Notifications should contain the task's title and description.
   ● When the user clicks on the notification, the app should open directly to the task details
   screen.

● Implement a search bar to filter tasks by title.
● Provide an option to clear completed tasks.

Guidelines:
● The app should be responsive and look good on both small and large screens.
● Ensure the code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices.

Deliverables:
● A link to the project repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
● Instructions on how to set up and run the project on a local machine.
● A video of the app working in either Android / IOS.
